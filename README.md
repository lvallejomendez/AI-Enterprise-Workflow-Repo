#### Case Study - Data ingestion
The goal of this case study is to put into practice the important concepts from module 1. We will go through the basic process that begins with refining the business opportunity and ensuring that it is articulated using a scientific thought process.

The business opportunity and case study was first mentioned in Unit 2 of module 1 and like the AAVIAL company itself these data were created for learning purposes. We will be using the AAVAIL example as a basis for this case study. You will be gathering data from several provided sources, staging it for quality assurance and saving it in a target destination that is most appropriate.

#### Case study overall objectives
1. Gather all relevant data from the sources of provided data
2. Implement several checks for quality assurance
3. Take the initial steps towards automation of the ingestion pipeline
